# Cpp-Sequencer

This project was aimed at learning how to build a more complex object oriented environment using C++. This project was colaborative and my partner was [Graeme Gengras](https://github.com/ggengras). 

See the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm_v3JoFSZ0&t=5s) video for a better look at the output of the project.
